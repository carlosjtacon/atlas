### Track posts

Instead of using a post category I will generate the tracks page and viewer from the files in this folder. They should follow the naming convention: `$date_$category_$what_$where.gpx`.

If I am loading this tracks in a post I would use the post category, otherwise I will just put `track` as category.

- `$date`: YYYYMM
- `$category`: track | day | trip
- `$what`: activity-activity-... 1toN
- `$where`: sentence-or-just-a-word

**Examples:**
- 202501_day_tourism_oxford.gpx
- 202304_day_hiking_suffolk.gpx
- 202304_track_cycling_ev1-ireland-north.gpx
- 202304_trip_hiking-tourism-roadtrip_scotland.gpx
